# LLM CARBON TRACKER --DUMB CATCHY NAME NOT THOUGHT OF YET

    This is a personal project web-app that tracks the carbon output of AI/LLM Prompts.

    I got the idea when one of my lecturers randomly mentioned that AI prompts do create a carbon output.

    All Data is valid through 2025 and is pulled from the Electricity Maps API
